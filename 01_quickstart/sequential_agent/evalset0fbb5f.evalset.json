This could be improved by using an array-like data structure or an iterative approach without using lists.\n\n### Improvable Code Quality\n\n- Variable name `num_terms` could be renamed to something more descriptive like `number_of_terms` for clarity.\n- Consider adding documentation (docstring) to the functions to describe their purpose, parameters, and return values.\n- `compute_fibonacci` could be simplified by directly returning the result of calling `fibonacci(n)` without assigning it to an intermediate variable.\n\n### Code Formatting\n\n- Consistent indentation (4 spaces) throughout the code ensures readability and professionalism in code style."
